# Inventory-Program

This is my first project in Java as well as my first JavaFX application that I created in NetBeans for my Software I class at WGU. The program allows the user to add, modify, and delete parts and products. They can describe said parts and products by name or ID and attach with various attributes such as inventory level, price, max and min values, and whether they are made “In-House” or “Outsourced”.

It's pretty straight forward as it was designed to achieve specific goals.

This project utilizes concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction which should ensure the application’s sociability.
